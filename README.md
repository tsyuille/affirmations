 ## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This site uses an API that I built to generate an affirmation when the user clicks the button. Initally the project was built with the affirmations 
hardcoded into the JavaScript. I improved upon the project by making my own API to house the affirmations.
